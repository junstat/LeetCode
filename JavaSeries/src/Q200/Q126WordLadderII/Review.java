   A transformation sequence from word beginWord to word endWord using a dictionary wordList is a sequence of words such that:
    - The first word in the sequence is beginWord.
    - The last word in the sequence is endWord.
    - Only one letter is different between each adjacent pair of words in the sequence.
    - Every word in the sequence is in wordList.
   Given two words, beginWord and endWord, and a dictionary wordList, return all the shortest transformation sequences from beginWord to endWord, or an empty list if no such sequence exists.

    Example 1:
        Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
        Output: [["hit","hot","dot","dog","cog"],["hit","hot","lot","log","cog"]]

    Example 2:
        Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
        Output: []
        Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore no possible transformation.

    Constraints:
    1 <= beginWord.length <= 10
    endWord.length == beginWord.length
    1 <= wordList.length <= 5000
    wordList[i].length == beginWord.length
    beginWord, endWord, and wordList[i] consist of lowercase English letters.
    beginWord != endWord
    All the strings in wordList are unique.
