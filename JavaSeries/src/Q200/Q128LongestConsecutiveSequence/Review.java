package Q200.Q128LongestConsecutiveSequence;

/*
   Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
    Example 1:
        Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
        Output: 4
        Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
    Example 2:
        Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
        Output: 9

    Constraints:
        0 <= nums.length <= 10^4
        -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
